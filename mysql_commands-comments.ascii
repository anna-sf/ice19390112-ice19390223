#The series of MySQL commands you provided are correct for setting up replication and creating a database with a table. Here's a breakdown of each command:
mysql>CREATE USER 'replica'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'abc123';

#This command creates a new user 'replica' with the password 'abc123' who can connect from any host ('%').
mysql>GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'replica'@'%';

#This command grants replication slave privileges to the 'replica' user, allowing it to replicate data from the master server.
mysql>show grants for replica@'%';

#This command displays the granted privileges for the 'replica' user.
mysql>CHANGE MASTER TO
	MASTER_HOST='master',
	MASTER_USER='replica',
	MASTER_PASSWORD='abc123',

#This command configures the replication master details, specifying the host as 'master', the replication user as 'replica', and the password as 'abc123'.
mysql>START SLAVE;

#This command starts the replication process, allowing the replica server to begin replicating data from the master.
mysql>CREATE DATABASE Students;

#This command creates a new database named 'Students'.
mysql>SHOW DATABASES;

#This command lists all the available databases.
mysql>USE Students;

#This command switches the current database context to 'Students', meaning that any subsequent table creation or manipulation commands will be applied to this database.
mysql>CREATE TABLE Students_Info (
	AM int,
	LastName varchar(255),
	FirstName varchar(255),
	Address varchar(255),
	Semester int,
	Passed_Subjects int,
	Declared_Subjects int );
  
  
#This command creates a new table named 'Students_Info' within the 'Students' database. The table has several columns such as 'AM', 'LastName', 'FirstName', 'Address', 'Semester', 'Passed_Subjects', and 'Declared_Subjects', each with its respective data type.

#Overall, these commands set up replication between the master and replica servers, create a database named 'Students', and define a table named 'Students_Info' within that database.
